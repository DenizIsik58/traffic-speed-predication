Everything in this repository is currently under development. The following information given is used to boot up the application for development purposes.
## Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following software installed before running the application:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Manual installation

In order to run the application manually, use the following command:

```docker-compose up -d```

Please keep in mind that docker doesn't provide docker-compose binary in some operating systems and could therefore be a reason for the command to fail. In that case you need to manually install it.

## Installation via scripts

A BASH and PowerShell script has been written to start up docker. The scripts will automatically start 2 containers - a postgres container for the database and the application.

**Unix:** sh StartApplication.sh 

**Windows:** ps StartApplication.ps1

You should now be able to visit https://localhost:8000

## .ENV
A .env file can be found in the source code in the following format:
```
POSTGRES_USER="<username>"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<password>"
POSTGRES_DB="<dbname>"
POSTGRES_HOST="db"
ConnectionString_TSP:"Server=db;Database=<dbname>;UserId=<username>;Password=<password>"
```
Make sure to change the credentials inside the `traffic_speed_prediction/settings.py` file, so they match.
