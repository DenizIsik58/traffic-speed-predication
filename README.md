Everything in this repository is currently under development and is being developed for the company <u>[Solita](https://www.solita.fi/en/?utm_campaign=EST:+Brand&utm_term=solita&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_kw=solita&hsa_acc=2178929025&hsa_mt=e&hsa_grp=123766618555&hsa_tgt=kwd-334844187&hsa_src=g&hsa_cam=13334249436&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ad=525097120039&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjw9-KTBhBcEiwAr19igyzTDgaTbxDB4OXuDHPWwFqxYIEXXrlGfyWRza2-p1sCwaj-uH7nPBoCzR4QAvD_BwE) </u>. The following information provided is used to boot up the application for development purposes or deploying the docker stack to production.


This repository is managed by dependabot in order to keep all packages up to date and be alerted if there are any vulnerabilities in the source code.
## Development

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following software installed before running the application:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


Also, it is important to import 2 .env files. One for the `Frontend` and one for the `App`:

**App:**
```
NODE_ENV=<production/development>
POSTGRES_USER=<username>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password>
POSTGRES_DB=<dbname>
POSTGRES_HOST=db
SECRET_KEY=<a strong auto generated key (should be 100+ characters long)>
```

**Frontend:**

```
NODE_ENV=<production/development>
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_SECRET_KEY=<MapBoxSecretKey>
REACT_APP_BACKEND_PRODUCTION_URL=https://tsp.hostanything.org
REACT_APP_BACKEND_DEVELOPMENT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Both .env files contains a variable called NODE_ENV representing the current state of the project. It's very <u>IMPORTANT</u> to update these as it can expose harmful information inside the project to the user, if it ends out in production. 

Change the value to `development` when you are in development or `production` when you are going to deploy.


### Manual installation

#### App:
In order to run the application manually, make sure to navigate to the `App` folder and run the following command:

```docker-compose up -d```

Please keep in mind that docker doesn't provide docker-compose binary for some operating systems, and could therefore be a reason for the command to fail. In that case, you'll need to manually install it.

#### Frontend:

In order to run the frontend in development all you need to do is to navigate to the `Frontend/reactjs` folder and run the following command:

`npm start`

You should now be able to visit http://localhost:3000

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Frontend in production:
If you want to see how it looks and functions in production you first need to build the react application and serve it for the public:

```
1. npm run build
2. serve -s build
```



## Continuous deployment

Every time the development team publishes a release, a new docker image for the application and frontend will be built and pushed to **GitHub package registry** using GitHub actions. Make sure to add your GitHub access token into your repository. [Follow this tutorial to add secrets to your repository.](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)

The docker stack is managed by **shepherd**, which will check for new package version every 5 minutes and update the services on the host machine if there are any changes.

[Shepherd](https://github.com/djmaze/shepherd) is a utility to automatically update your services whenever their image is updated (Upon making a release).


### Deploying the stack

Docker swarm has been used for the deployment stack as it allows the development team to manage multiple containers across multiple hosts. It is also very beneficial as it gives high availability and makes it easy to scale.

`sudo docker swarm init` - This will initialize a new cluster for the services. It generates two random tokens, a worker token and a manager token. When you join a new node to the swarm, the node joins as a worker or manager node based upon the token you pass to swarm join.

`sudo docker stack deploy -c deployment.yml tsp` - This will deploy the complete application stack to the swarm by using the *deployment.yml* file.
